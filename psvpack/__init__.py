# To revert back to defaults, simply delete this file, and it will be recreated

# Be sure to set the following values correctly:
# * pkg2zip  - Path to the pkg2zip binary (if you're unsure, run `which pkg2zip`)
# * tsv_urls - TSV update URLs (should be obtained independently); required for operation
#
# Optional:
# * install_root - can be set to the correct path to have psvpack automatically
#                  install packages to your Vita while it's plugged in
#                  (for example, it might be auto-mounted to `/media/USER/xxxxx`).
#                  By default, the current directory is used.
# * cache_dir    - Path to where pkg files are downloaded (cache_dir/pkg)
# * cache_ttl    - Max age (in seconds) of TSV files before they are refreshed
